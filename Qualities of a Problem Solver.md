## Independence

If a person doesn't liberate oneself from unnecessary interactions and dependencies with the outside world, they would themselves distracted away from their efforts towards a life purpose. A confidence in one's own worth and abilities keeps an individual firm against judgemental and negative reactions of others.

## Resilience
