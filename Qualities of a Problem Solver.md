#  Qualities of a Problem Solver

## Purpose
In a world full of distractions, a person needs a pursuit, a vocation that would keep them focused on something that gives them a sense of meaning in life. 
When a person has found their life's purpose, they develop a perspective that views challenges as difficulties that must be overcome in order to towards their purpose. In spite of challenging circumstances, finding a meaningful purpose to devote one's time and energy will provide the essential drive to overcome all obstacles.

## Continuous Improvement
A person working towards a life's purpose will find oneself solving problems in small steps every single day. With this, the problem solver always know there is room for improvement and innovation for oneself or one's work.

## Independence
Only after overcoming the challenges the outside world brings can someone solve problems toward their own purpose. A person will become sidetracked from their efforts toward a life purpose if they don't liberate themselves from pointless interactions and dependencies with the outside world. A confidence in one's own worth and abilities keeps an individual firm against judgemental and negative reactions of others.

## Resilience
Never giving up, overcoming all obstacles and turning them into opportunities enables a problem solver to realize their life's purpose. The people who have made history have always been the ones who never gave up. Those who persevere through hardships and triumph where others would have lost hope will shape the future.

## Synergy
No matter how talented and creative a person is, they should be conscious that any collaboration will increase their effectiveness. Every person is only capable of having expertise in one area of problem solving. When pursuing something that will have an impact on the world, the problem solvers naturally find themselves collaborating with individuals who have different skills than their own. This will enable groups of individuals with a common vision to achieve results that are greater than the sum of their individual contributions (emergence).

## Presence of Mind
The mind has a tendency to become disoriented in the presence of emotional difficulties and distracting circumstances. The capacity to make the right decision at any time is essential for problem solvers. Distractions can be avoided by a mind that is aware of itself and its surroundings. Maintaining one's focus on one's purpose will give them the time and mental energy they need to pursue continuous improvement.

## Minimalism
Keeping everything simple helps to prevent complicated problems from arising. Similarly, a minimalistic lifestyle allows an individual to attain their full potential by eliminating distractions.

## Willingness to Act ( Handlungsbereitschaft )
In this world, everyone has dreams, but very few people actually make them come true. A problem solver recognizes an opportunity or a problem where it is and takes the required action to resolve it.

## Positive Attitude 
It is the belief that anything can be solved with the appropriate problem-solving mindset. History has repeatedly demonstrated that with the appropriate attitude, people can successfully handle any issue or situation. A person will remain strong no matter what by making the most of what they have with a resourceful viewpoint, seeing opportunities in obstacles, and having the mindset of a winner, not the victim mindset of a loser.
