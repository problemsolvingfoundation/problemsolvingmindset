## Independence
An individual can only solve problems towards their own purpose only when they have overcome the obstacles society presents. 

## Resilience
Never giving up, overcoming all obstacles and turning them into opportunities enables a problem solver to realize their life's purpose. It's indeed those who never that achieve what they desire in life and tackle all challenges, unexpected or expected.

## Synergy

History has shown time and time again that human beings can successfully deal with any problem or circumstance with the right attitude. Making the most out of what you have with a resourceful viewpoint, seeing all obstacles into opportunities in one's path and having the mindset of a winner, not the victim mindset of a loser, will keep an individual strong amidst everything.
