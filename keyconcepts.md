Just as an initial draft for the key concepts:

We have to prioritize those two when we code the problem-solving mindset:
1- Systems thinking (System theory in general)
2- Minimalism.

Because all of the others stem from those two. Even a problem or a solution can be defined as a "system" that consists of interrelated subsystems. 

For instance, a problem is a system that becomes an obstacle against the existence or stability of another system.

Minimalism is the design strategy of problem-solving as minimalism makes it easier to detect and fix errors; enhance or refactor subsystems.

(Related to minimalism: Law of Demeter (the principle of least knowledge), the principle of least privilege, the principle of least effort, the principle of least action.)


Kaizen, continuous improvement, minimalism.

Lean Manufacturing, Toyota Production System, Taiichi Ohno

Lean, Kanban, Agile (and some implementations of Agile like: Scrum, Extreme Programming) problem-solving methodologies.

Systems Thinking, Creative Thinking, Design Thinking, Strategic Thinking.

Gestalt psychology.

Reducing all problems into "the communication problems between systems"

Linguistics as it is the basis for systems communication.

Visualizing problems and solutions.

# Autonomous Teams

Organizing autonomous teams. These teams should loosely-coupled, especially through the outer circles and ephemerals of the problem-solving spiral.
(Getting inspired by algorithms and data structures in order to organize teams as interrelated subsystems.)

How would you describe an ideal autonomous team?:
 
The team as an orchestra. 

An orchestra conductor instead of a cult leader.

Team members who play different instruments but for the sake of a mutual vision and harmony.

Principles that allow improvision like the musical notes, instead of strict rules.
