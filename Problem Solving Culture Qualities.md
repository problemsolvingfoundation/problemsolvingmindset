# Qualities of Problem Solving Culture

## Vision
A vision that presents individuals a common purpose will unite them towards working together. People who know they are working for something greater will become more motivated in their work. The vision offers a basis for people to create their individual purposes, which helps to create a sense of meaning in one's own work as well as in the work of those with the shared vision.

## Continuous Improvement
The problem solving culture with a shared vision is the most fertile habitat upon which problem solvers can thrive. In this world, problems never cease to arise and there is always room for improvement, fixing and innovation. If an organization guided by the problem solving culture tackles all problems continuously under the light of a vision, it will build itself step by step and attain a stable position of increasing strength. 

## Synergy
A system with synergy is greater than the sum of its parts. Problem solving culture organizes problem solvers in such a way to promote synergy without infringing the independence of the problem solvers. Synergy can be reached by establishing positive dynamics, namely by allowing right problem solvers to work on right problems and creating a problem solving environment, with a shared agenda reflecting the current progress towards the vision and purposeful interaction on the forefront.

## Autonomous Subsystems
A culture with a vision requires the accomplishment of a vast variety of problems. As each problem requires a different set of problem solving skills, trying to micromanage subsystems qualified in a certain field, be it teams or individuals, will restrict their problem solving capacity. Given qualified subsystems, the problem solving culture helps to organize them in a way that makes them loosely coupled and highly cohesive, exactly what's needed for creating synergy with purposeful interactions and reducing waste of time and resources.
