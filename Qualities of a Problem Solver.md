#  Qualities of a Problem Solver

## Purpose

## Independence

## Resilience
Never giving up, overcoming all obstacles and turning them into opportunities enables a problem solver to realize their life's purpose. It's indeed those who never that achieve what they desire in life and tackle all challenges, unexpected or expected.

## Synergy
How creative and skilfull an individual may be, they should be aware of the fact that any collaboration will amplify their efficiency. People working under a shared vision will produce results that are greater than sum of their parts (emergence).

## Presence of Mind
The problem solver should be ready to make the right decision at any moment. The secret to achieving a clear mind that will continue to work toward one's life mission is to remain concentrated in the face of distracting situations and emotional challenges.

History has repeatedly demonstrated that with the appropriate attitude, people can successfully handle any issue or situation. A person will remain strong no matter what by making the most of what they have with a resourceful viewpoint, seeing opportunities in obstacles, and having the mindset of a winner, not the victim mindset of a loser.
