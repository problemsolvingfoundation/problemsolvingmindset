# Qualities of Problem Solving Culture

## Vision
A vision that presents individuals a common purpose will unite them towards working together. People who know they are working for something greater will become more motivated in their work. The vision offers a basis for people to create their individual purposes, which helps to create a sense of meaning in one's own work as well as in the work of those with the shared vision.

## Continuous Improvement
The problem solving culture with a shared vision is the most fertile habitat upon which problem solvers can thrive. In this world, problems never cease to arise and developments around us offer new opportunities for improvement. If an organization guided by the problem solving culture confronts all problems continuously under the light of a vision, it will build itself in small incremental steps and reach a steady position of increasing strength.

## Synergy
A system with synergy is greater than the sum of its parts. The culture of problem-solving allows the organization of problem solvers to foster synergy without compromising their independence. Synergy can be reached by establishing positive dynamics, namely by allowing right problem solvers to work on right problems and creating a collaborative environment with a shared agenda reflecting the current progress towards the vision. When purposeful interaction is in the forefront, communication encourages collaborative problem solving and individuals are less likely to impede each other's progress.

## Autonomous Subsystems
A culture with a vision requires the accomplishment of a vast variety of problems. As each problem requires a different set of problem solving skills, trying to micromanage subsystems qualified in a certain field, be it teams or individuals, will restrict their problem solving capacity. Making problem-solving subsystems loosely coupled and highly cohesive will ensure that purposeful interactions will take place without dependencies, exactly what's needed for increasing creativity and reducing waste of time and resources.

## Common Comunication Means
Communicating a problem is almost as important as solving it. One mistake in the transmission of information, and you may end up with mistakes that cause unexpected consequences. That's why it's important to establish a common language with terms that have unambigous meaning among the members of an organization. Knowing how to communicate ideas in a domain, problem solvers will feel more open to share ideas with each other, preventing the fear of misunderstanding.

## Fairness
Each problem solver should be provided with sufficient rewards for their services performed. Distributing problem solvers what they have deserved will motivate them towards becoming more efficient and professional in their, as they will consider organization recompensing their efforts as reliable.

## Positive Attitude
It is impossible to create a psychologically safe environment in an accusatory, judgmental and passive-agressive culture. In a negative environment, people will try to hide their emotions and mistakes which will hinder the creativity of an organization. A problem-solving culture is understanding and forgiving with a positive attitude toward mistakes, considering them as learning opportunities and experiences. A positive attitude will also help to build a positive image of quality, which is the best way of finding allies with similar positivity in a competitive world.

## Encouragement
A problem-solving culture encourages problems solving to be their best versions, to achieve their potential promoting their willingness to act.

## Minimalism
Problem-solving culture should promote minimalism to prevent collective waste of time and energy. Minimalism helps to detect and handle problems faster in an organisation.
