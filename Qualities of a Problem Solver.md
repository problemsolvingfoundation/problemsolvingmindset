#  Qualities of a Problem Solver

## Purpose
In a world full of distractions, a person needs a pursuit, a vocation that would keep them focused on something that gives them a sense of meaning in life. 
The person who has determined a life purpose attains a mindset that interprets obstacles in their life as problems to be solved for their purpose in life. Occupying oneself with a meaningful purpose will provide the necessary motivation for overcoming all problems despite difficult circumstances.

## Continuous Improvement
A person working towards a life's purpose will find oneself solving problems in small steps every single day. With this, the problem solver always know there is room for improvement and innovation for oneself or one's work.

## Independence
An individual can solve problems towards their own purpose only when they have overcome the obstacles the world presents. If a person doesn't liberate oneself from unnecessary interactions and dependencies with the outside world, they would themselves distracted away from their efforts towards a life purpose. A confidence in one's own worth and abilities keeps an individual firm against judgemental and negative reactions of others.

## Resilience
Never giving up, overcoming all obstacles and turning them into opportunities enables a problem solver to realize their life's purpose. Those who have shaped the past have always been those who have never given up. The future will similarly be created by those that withstand and overcome difficulties where others would have forsaken all hopes.

## Synergy
How creative and skilfull an individual may be, they should be aware of the fact that any collaboration will amplify their efficiency. Each human is only capable of being qualified only in some field of problem solving. When pursuing something that will have an effect on the world, the problem solver finds oneself naturally in collaboration with those who have different strengths than one's own. With this, people working under a shared vision will produce results that are greater than sum of their parts (emergence).

## Presence of Mind
The mind has a tendency to become disoriented in the presence of emotional difficulties and distracting circumstances. The capacity to make the right decision at any time is essential for problem solvers. Distractions can be avoided by a mind that is aware of itself and its surroundings. Maintaining one's focus on one's purpose will give them the time and mental energy they need to pursue continuous improvement.

## Minimalism
Keeping everything simple helps to prevent complicated problems from arising. Similarly, a minimalistic lifestyle allows an individual to attain their full potential by eliminating distractions.

## Willingness to Act ( Handlungsbereitschaft )
In this world, everyone has dreams, but very few people actually make them come true. A problem solver recognizes an opportunity or a problem where it is and takes the required action to resolve it.

## Positive Attitude 
It is the belief that anything can be solved with the appropriate problem-solving mindset. History has repeatedly demonstrated that with the appropriate attitude, people can successfully handle any issue or situation. A person will remain strong no matter what by making the most of what they have with a resourceful viewpoint, seeing opportunities in obstacles, and having the mindset of a winner, not the victim mindset of a loser.
