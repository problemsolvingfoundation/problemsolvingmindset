# Autonomous Teams

Organizing autonomous teams. These teams should loosely-coupled, especially through the outer circles and ephemerals of the problem-solving spiral.
(Getting inspired by algorithms and data structures in order to organize teams as interrelated subsystems.)

How would you describe an ideal autonomous team?:
 
The team as an orchestra. 

An orchestra chief instead of a cult leader.

Team members who play different instruments but for the sake of a mutual vision and harmony.

Principles that allow improvision like the musical notes, instead of strict rules.
