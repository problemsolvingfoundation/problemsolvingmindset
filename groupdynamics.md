 We should develop the first "group dynamics engine" or maybe in the future "group dynamics operating system" of the planet earth.
 It may be used in robots acting collectively, in games where clans exist, and in all the systems that need social interaction based on group dynamics.
 Reward/Punishment system, ranking-level system, adminship/moderatorship system, belonging system are just subsystems of it.
